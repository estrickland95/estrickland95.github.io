      <div id="box2"><h1>Fishkeeping 101</h1></div>

      <div id="box3"><p>Fishkeeping has been one of my favorite hobbies since high school and a way of coping with anxiety. There is something calming about watching a little ecosystem come to life on your kitchen counter - especially when things are going right. To ensure smooth sailing, it is always best to do some basic research on anything you want to change or add to your aquarium. Having a basic understanding of filtration, light, plants, and the specific needs of the fish species you plan to keep is the first step to building something beautiful!</p>
                     <p>These are a few things I wish had been explained to me before I got into the hobby (it would have saved me a lot of money!). Keep in mind this is for freshwater tanks only - Saltwater is a whole nother’ ball game! </p>

                    <h2>Filtration Basics</h2>
                      <p>There are two types of filtration going on in most successful aquariums: <i>biological</i> and <b>mechanical</b>. Biological filtration happens when beneficial bacteria in the aquarium break down fish waste and other toxins in the water. These bacteria colonize in the gravel, on the surface of decorations, and most abundantly inside of filter media. Sponge filters provide a great surface for these bacteria to grow as the surface area is so large. Biological filtration happens naturally in every healthy stream, river, lake ect.! Plants can also serve as biological filters absorbing the nutrients created from this breakdown process.</p>
                      <p>Mechanical filtration happens when you have an actual filter in your tank that removes larger particles. This takes all the large chunks of food, waste, or rotting plant bits out of your display - keeping your water looking nice and pristine!</p>

                    <h2>Aquatic Plants</h2>
                      <i>no you don’t have to water them</i>
                      <p>That doesn’t mean they can’t be tricky! There are a wide variety of plants available, though some are easier to care for than others. Some plants seem to flourish in any conditions, but others are very sensitive to the amount of light and nutrients available to them. Starter plants are typically those that don’t require any fancy lighting or fertilizers. Some of my favorites include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Java Fern</li>
                        <li>Anubias Nano</li>
                        <li>Amazon Swords</li>
                        <li>Mosses - Christmas or Java</li>
                        <li>Duckweed (Be warned, it can quickly grow out of control!)</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>There are a wide variety of resources available online, including video. I reccomend following up with Aquarium Co-op here:</p>

                     <h2>Lighting</h2>
                        <p>The type of lighting will mostly depend on the needs of your plants. Many pre-assembled kits come with great lights that can sustain starter plants or low light plants with ease. Some species such as <i>crassicaulis</i> have very specific lighting needs, and need certain intensity bulbs - something I have steered away from.</p>
                        <p>Nowadays LED lights are the way to go. They stay bright, are more energy efficient, and won’t heat up your aquarium after being on for too long.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps equally as important as the type of bulb is the length of time you keep it on for. A timer (it plugs into your electrical outlet, and the light plugs into it) can help you keep your lighting consistent and avoid leaving it on for longer than needed. Too much light can lead to algae blooms, while too little can kill off your plants. A good start is 6-8 hours of direct light. It may not seem like a lot, but any longer and you’ll get some first hand experience in scrubbing down your tank.</p>

                <p>Livebearers include guppies, platies (shown above), endlers, and quite a few other genuses. They get their name from the fact that they give live birth! These fish have quick gestation periods and pop out babies as long as there are males and females in the same thank. Because of this, and their hardy nature they are a very common selection for a new aquarist! The wide variety of colors and species are still a big draw to long time aquarists as well.</p>

                <h2>Bettas</h2>
                <p>Betta fish are no doubt another very popular fish for those starting out. They are very hardy and can survive in even the most unstable aquarium. To really bring out their colors and personality, try keeping them in a 5 gallon or larger tank! Some bettas tolerate other fish (without flowing fins) while others will need to be kept alone. The number of different fin tpyes and colors are endless! One of my favorite fish to keep by far (:</p>

                <p>Two very popular bottom dwellers are corry catfish and khuli loaches. Corry cats tend to be very active and enjoy swimming in groups of six plus. They eat uneaten bits of food from the gravel and can even be seen blinking! Khuli loaches are noctural and much harder to spot, however their unique body shape and contrasting stripes make them an attractive choice to many people.</p>
